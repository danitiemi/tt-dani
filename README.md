# Technical Test

*Given the following user story:*
```
As a user, I want the ability to submit pictures to a website.
```

*Aceptance Criteria*
- Validate the extension (jpg/png only)
- Content doesn't need to be validated (simple file extension validation only)
- On success, display the following message: "Success"
- On failure, display the following message: "Failure"
- Only one photo can be sent at a time
- The API must delete the file that was sent -- don't have to worry about storing it somewhere or writing to DB

*Please submit the following:*
- An example REST API in `node.js` that you've written (a single verb -- `POST` -- is fine)
- An Angular 5 app that `POSTS` to the API 

Don't worry about styling

# Scoring is based on:
- Functionality
- Code

Please submit a `pull request` to this repository by *Midnight, Thursday, November 29, 2018*
